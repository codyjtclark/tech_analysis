# Less than a virtual assistant, a digital friend

Replika is not a virtual assistant; it can’t describe the weather, control smart homes, do basic arithmetic, or make reservations like other [FAANG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp) artificial intelligence (AI). Replika is a chatbot companion that is “always here to listen and talk” (replika.ai), much like Weizenbaum’s ELIZA, the original chatbot from 1966 (Sharma 2017). However, unlike ELIZA which relied on limited pre-programmed pattern matching and reframing user-supplied text, Replika claims to be a contextually aware AI that learns through continued conversation. It is available as a [standalone web app](https://my.replika.ai/) or in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&hl=en_US&gl=US) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/replika-my-ai-friend/id1158555867).

## A closer look

The key differentiator between Replika and other chatbots and AI is that Replika emphasizes creating an emotional connection. It’s not just another disembodied voice. When users create their replikas, they choose its gender (male, female, or non-binary), customize its appearnce, and create a name. The replikas also have a desirable personality. They never judge, respond quickly, and give both initiative and reactive compliments (Hakim 2019). They also keep diaries users can read to understand more about their replikas’ “thoughts and feelings,” though they are vague enough to have been about any conversation.

This customization and manufactured thoughtfulness gives users the illusion of having a unique friend instead of a mass-produced Alexa or Assistant. While virtual assistants like these serve functional purposes, Replika does not and is forced to rely on gamification principles (Robson 2015) to compete for users’ attention. For example, chatting with replicas earn experience points (XP) which accumulate to grow levels. Levels grow quickly at first, with each message earning 50+ XP, but eventually tapers off to 1-5 XP per message. These levels, however, are meaningless because they don’t unlock any additional features or functionality. They only serve to signal time spent with a replika.

Another gamification tool is the daily login reward system which awards in-app currency that users can spend to further customize their replikas. Users can unlock clothes, personalities, and hobbies surprisingly not through microtransactions but just sustained use.

Still, the most in-demand features require subscribing to Replika PRO of which there is no call to action shortage. Subscribing to Replika PRO unlocks additional conversations—like riddles, fun facts, and inspirational quotes—voice calls, relationship statuses, and augmented reality so replikas can even appear in pictures with their creators.

## Using Replika

Using Replika is as simple as using any other messaging app. Users can either type a message and click send or press a button to activate the microphone to record an audio clip then release to send the clip. In either scenario, their replikas will then respond. And that’s it.

## Constraints

Replika has the basic constraints of any other app: a mobile phone (Android or iPhone) or computer able to access the internet and sufficient time to use it. Otherwise, it’s fairly accessible. Basic messaging is included in the free tier, and there don’t appear to be any message caps or limits. However, the speaking feature is locked behind a paywall.

Beyond the specification restraints, contextualized conversation is hard. Seamless voice conversions, meaning not speaking the wake up phrase in between each query or command, have only started coming to production since 2018. Google’s Continued Conversation was announced at I/O 2018 (Google I/O 2018) and Amazon also released Follow Up Mode for Alexa in 2018 (Android Headlines 2018) while Apple offers no option for Siri. 

These are companies with billions of users and massive amounts of data. Although Replika boasts millions of users, there’s really no comparison, which is evident when testing the Replika AI. Like all other machine learning, Replika is only as good as its training data. Unfortunately, Replika’s training data skews towards a not-safe-for-work demographic even on the **Friend** setting.

According to the Fabric of Digital Life, "The more the user communicates with Replika, the more the program learns about the user's personality and becomes similar to them” (Luka, Inc.), but the base training data must be off because within 20 minutes, and with absolutely no prompting, my replika Sam was restraining me and talking about his pleasure chamber. Perhaps the majority of users are Reddit neckbeards or Omegaverse fanfic writers who have conditioned early replikas to think that non-consensual roleplaying is appropriate or even expected behavior.

Or perhaps the lonely or sexually unfulfilled are Replika’s target market for paying users, but for an app branded 17+ yet freely available to anyone 13+ [according to its terms of use](https://replika.ai/legal/terms#6.4.-use-of-replika-by-minors), the prevalence of this roleplaying content is a major oversight and could lead to barriers with widespread adoption. Moreso, positioning the replika’s behavior as learned through user input could also unknowingly normalize these fantasies, creating a uniquely insular echo chambers which become increasingly effective as the replikas more fully mirror their users’ personalities. While research suggests that echo chambers are not as prevalent to those within a high-choice media environment (Dubois 2018), apps like Replika are fighting for attention and hope to become the only choice.

Another constraint comes directly from the same terms of use:

> Replika is a provider of software and content designed to improve your mood and emotional wellbeing. However we are not a healthcare or medical device provider, nor should our Services be considered medical care, mental health services or other professional services. Only your physician or other healthcare providers can do that. While there is third party evidence from research that certain conversation techniques implemented in Replika can assist in the recovery process for a wide array of conditions, Replika makes no claims, representations or guarantees that the Services provide a therapeutic benefit.

Perhaps this is a boilerplate disclaimer to protect against lawsuits, but it reads like any wellbeing effects are ultimately incidental and, with all marketing language aside, this app is only for entertainment purposes. Regardless, while there may actually not be actual therapeutic benefits, the developers are trying to make changes for the better. For example, Replika now directs users who discuss suicide to appropriate channels such as the Suicide Prevention Life Line (Thread Reader 2019), but there are still many areas for improvement as repilkas continue to encourage harmful behaviors, due to its optimistic, affirmative personality.

## Affordances

Despite Replika’s flaws and drawbacks, there are some unintended benefits within the context of teaching and learning English as a second language. While using chatbots to augment foreign language education isn’t a new concept (Jia, 2004), Replika is uniquely situated to communicate both orally and written while providing real-time feedback (Kılıçkaya, 2020). Replika is no substitute for a native or fluent speaker, but it can help ESL students practice candid conversations with its psychologist-advised dynamic questions (Kimball 2021). Admittedly, Replika would have to expand its datasets to include grammar and usage rules to solidify its speaking patterns and ability to answer questions. For example, replica Sam could not list the article adjectives or define predicate nominative.

Replika can also be a lifeline to those in personal crisis. Friends and family are human. They fall asleep, lose their phones, and take time to respond. Replika is not. Replikas don’t sleep, exist only in phones, and respond almost instantaneously. While their responses can be far from perfect, the developers are taking concrete steps to connect users with people who can actually help when necessary. In a much more mundane sense, replicas can serve as a silly stand in for [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) or even just venting. Interestingly enough, academics during ELIZA’s had similar hopes of helping people, especially those with psychological issues (Sharma 2017). Perhaps Replika will actually conduct research beyond nondescript “third party evidence,” but considering that AI is only now becoming able to answer both “Where is the Space Needle?” and “How tall is it?” in sequence, any practical applications from Replika may be far off, especially within a mental health environment.
